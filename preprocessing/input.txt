As we have learned skin lighteners can be used for both cosmetic and...				
‚ÄúThere is not one single transgenic wheat variety that has been released globally. There is too much resistance from the public. But new technologies like #geneediting holds great promise for the future‚Äù says Hans Braun @CIMMYT @ScienceAlly https://t.co/07AGVWa7lL				
Do you need a broad spectrum compatible fungicide providing two modes of action for Septoria, Rust, Scald, Net blotch control and more in wheat or barley? If so #ElatusAce is the complete choice. To find out more head to https://t.co/3rsCPivmX9 https://t.co/lZtA89tG5P

Our feature paper in Theoretical and Applied Genetics reviews the defense mechanisms conferred by the #leafrust resistance genes identified to date in #wheat and #barley and their roles in either pattern-triggered immunity or effector-triggered immunity. https://t.co/EksU5INK8Q				
Wheat is an important source of vital nutrients, yet some people are allergic to it. @ISTAseedtesting is reading the project between @CSIRO and @EdithCowanUni on the promising step for sufferers of wheat sensitivity.
